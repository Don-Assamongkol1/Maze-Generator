Next steps:
more algorithms
get buttons to stop freezing after the algo is done running how?
Braiding!?!?!

(Extra)
Make visualizations more intuitive

See if this is needed: 
sidewinder show group of cells that are candidates and the one that gets a wall 
drilled through

biases = eg. fewer dead ends 
trade dead ends for longer corridors --> rivers
